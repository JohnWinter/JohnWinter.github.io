The purpose of this website is to demonstrate the potential of using social network metrics to identify manic behavior.

I was witness to a manic episode that presented itself clearly on social media long before a mental health professional became involved. I hope to work with mental health professionals to test the benefits of such a tool and investigate areas of concern, e.g. confidentiality.
