title: Twitch Discovery

The purpose of this website is to connect video game enthusiasts with Twitch Streamers that can provide information about games they might be interested in. I believe that the 1,000s of streamers on the Twitch platform that lack viewers represent latent value. I hope that this website can eventually unlock a portion of that value to its users. 

A secondary use of this site is to demonstrate the use of predictive analytics to Streamers. Streamers that play new games forecasted to perform well over the long term are likely to garner a first mover benefit over other Streamers. I hope to improve upon the model and demonstrate its accuracy as we have time to observe new release performance. 
 
The data is composed of Twitch viewer data since 2012 scraped from https://stats.twitchapps.com/ and video game tags scraped from http://store.steampowered.com/

Viewer data was converted to a daily game ranking. The target for the model was the number of days any game on the Steam platform was in the Twitch top 10.
