title: Twitch Discovery

The purpose of this website is to connect video game enthusiasts with Twitch Streamers that can provide information about games they might be interested in (based on the users tag input). I believe that the 1,000s of streamers on the Twitch platform that lack viewers is latent value. I hope that this website can unlock a portion of that value to its users.
